        Computes quadrature rule to approximate integral involving in volume rendering.
        Pixel colors are computed as weighted sums of radiance values collected along rays.

        For details on the quadrature rule, refer to 'Optical models for
        direct volume rendering (IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 1995)'.

        Args:
            sigma: Density values sampled along rays.
            radiance: Radiance values sampled along rays.
            delta: Distance between adjacent samples along rays.

        Returns:
            rgbs: Pixel colors computed by evaluating the volume rendering equation.
            weights: Weights used to determine the contribution of each sample to the final pixel color.
                A weight at a sample point is defined as a product of transmittance and opacity,
                where opacity (alpha) is defined as 1 - exp(-sigma * delta).
